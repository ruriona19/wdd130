        GREEK YOGURT NUTRITION BENEFITS
        Greek isn’t just a fancy name for yogurt. It’s for people who go BIG on nutrition and taste — like you. Good source of calcium? Yeah, that’s us. Want less lactose? Greek yogurt has less lactose than regular yogurt due to the straining process.
        You could say Greek yogurt is protein-famous, but that’s just part of the story. You’ll find a whole bunch of other epic benefits in every serving.
      </p>
      <p>
        CULTURES
        Cultures are the key to turning milk into yogurt. (In our case, ultra-creamy Greek yogurt.) They also do the all-important job of helping break down the lactose in milk.
      </p>
      <p>
        LACTOSE
        Because of the way it’s strained, Greek yogurt contains less lactose, and therefore less total sugar and fewer total carbs than the base of regular yogurt.
      </p>
      <p>
        GLUTEN FREE
        No worries here: our Greek yogurt does not contain gluten, and doesn’t come into contact with ingredients that contain gluten during the production process.
      </p>
      <p>  
        CALCIUM
        It’s a must for supporting strong bones, and you’ll find a good source of it in every 5.3-ounce serving of Oikos.
        PROTEIN
        Every 5.3-ounce serving has at least 11 grams of high-quality protein, which means your muscles are going to love it
      </p>
      <p>
        THE GREAT GREEK YOGURT VS. REGULAR YOGURT SMACKDOWN

        It takes about 2.5X more milk to make Greek yogurt than standard yogurt. That explains all that awesome protein.
        Greek yogurt is WAY thicker and creamier than regular yogurt. So, recipes love it right up.
        Individual flavors may vary, but because of the way it’s strained, Greek yogurt can be lower in total sugar than regular yogurt. Which also means lower in total carbs. If that’s what you’re into, you’re totally welcome.
