            Hello everyone!
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Roberto Uriona. I'm from Bolivia and married to my lovely wife Lindsay, together we have one child. 
            I joined the church when I was 15 years old and I am very grateful to our Heavenly Father for having known the gospel in my youth.
            In my free time, I enjoy playing team sports like soccer and basketball. This hobby not only helps me stay in shape but also helps 
            me spend quality time with family and friends.            
        </p>
        <p>     
                   
            I am majoring in Applied Technology and currently working as a web automation tester. 
            I hope to learn/increase our programming skills in this course so that we can improve our job opportunities and also be better instruments in the LordÂ´s hands.
